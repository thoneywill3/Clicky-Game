# Clicky Game

## Overview
This is a simple but addictive (and serverless) memory game built using React. It relies and CSS animations and the app's state to shuffle around the images available for clicking. 

See a live example here: [https://github.com/stoversa/clicky-game](https://github.com/stoversa/clicky-game). Please enjoy!
